"""Independent post-install validation of assembled npm trees.

After the container exits successfully, Constructor must not trust npm's
exit code.  ``validate_assembled_tree`` re-checks the assembled filesystem
against the validated lock closure:

* every expected package directory exists at its exact lock path;
* each on-disk ``package.json`` carries the expected name and version;
* the installed closure contains no extra package and no omitted optional
  that should have been left out;
* every locked dependency edge resolves through npm-style ``node_modules``
  ancestor lookup to an installed version satisfying its locked range;
* every entry is owned by the invoking user (or an explicitly supplied
  expected identity);
* no entry is group- or world-writable;
* every preserved reviewed-root ``bin`` target exists, is not a dangling
  symlink, and resolves inside the assembled tree;
* the tree contains no special files and no escaping symlink (delegated to
  :func:`build_tree_manifest`, which also hashes every regular file).

The function is pure w.r.t. the tree: it reads and validates but mutates
nothing.  ``make_tree_read_only`` is the separate mutation step that strips
every write bit before the canonical published-tree manifest is rebuilt.
